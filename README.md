- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm ZÃ¼leyha;
Since the beginning of 2022, I have been receiving training in the Front-End field and I want to improve myself in this field. For this, I am taking youtube videos, some courses from udemy and Meta Front-end training. I leave my Linkedin profile as a link below for your advice and opinions. 
Have a good day!
