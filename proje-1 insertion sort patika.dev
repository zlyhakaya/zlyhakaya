{22,27,16,2,18,6} -> insertion Sort

-----------Task 1 ----------

-sorting-

{22,27,16,2,18,6}
{2,22,27,16,18,6}
{2,6,22,27,16,18}
{2,6,16,22,27,18}
{2,6,16,18,22,27}

---------Task 2 -----------

As Big-O -->  O(n^2) 

------Task 3 -------------

-Time Complexity-

If the number we are looking for is in the start BEST CASE 
If the number we are looking for is in the middle AVERAGE CASE  
If the number we are looking for is in the end WORST CASE

we are looking for "18" ----------> AVAREGE CASE

------Task 4 ------------

- First step of sorting -------> {7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6} -

*Step 1 : [2,7,3,5,8,9,4,15,6]
*Step 2 : [2,3,7,5,8,9,4,15,6]
*Step 3 : [2,3,4,7,5,8,9,15,6]
*Step 4 : [2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]
*Step 5 : [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15]
